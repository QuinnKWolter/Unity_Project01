## A Game About Falling

The last two years have been hectic in a unique sort of way. My undergraduate career is falling further and further away behind me, and as time wears on, I find that I've lost contact with most of the people whom I grew up with in both Carlisle and Pittsburgh. Not only that, but people seem to be dying off with startling frequency: Suicide, violence, drugs, and alcoholism have laid claim to the men and women I used to sit beside in class, and speak with deep into the night. While there's been a particularly brutal streak only recently, my friend Kyle Yorlets is lodged most persistently in my head. Kyle's been in the national news as the clickable story of a young musician lost to senseless violence amidst a mugging gone wrong - perpetrated by children, no less (some as young as 12). In the aftermath of each person's passing, I look back on our digitally-preserved conversations, and it is in Kyle's that I found the seed for this game. In an old conversation, amidst emoji like those that make up most of my art assets, I see him venting about a feeling of hopelessness, of being adrift, of falling - time passing him by as he sluggishly races around trying to juggle his relationships, his passions, his student debts, and more. Now he and too many others are gone, and soon they'll be out of the news cycle, their memorialzied Facebook pages will go without visitors. Until then, I'll keep myself focused on growing and achieving, participating in my own race for the things I want.

This is a 2D game focused on lateral movement as a harmful zone of stress closes in, with nine different pickups - three each in three categories:
# Tokens
Tokens of the time we spend. These earn points and heal the player, as well as drive back the encroaching hurt zone and slow its progression.
# Cash
Cash buys time, giving a decent amount of points and pushing back the zone while simultaneously accelerating the rate at which it closes in.
# Obstacles
Objects that have served as harmful obstacles in the pursuit of wellbeing, both accelerating and drawing in the zone while directly harming the player on contact.

To Win: Score 3000 points while avoiding death.
To Lose: Lose all of your health to the zones and obstacles in the game.

What would I do differently?
1. Fine tune the balance of the various pickups to a greater extent.  I like where they're at, but I could control the pace of the game better.
2. Not get sick during development. Full-time work, evening classes, and a flu with a side of sinus infection has been just lovely in getting this done in a timely manner.
3. Fine tune the movement mechanics - I had to sacrifice time here in favor of other features, and it shows. Still, I can claim floatiness factors in intentionally.
4. And more, TBD
